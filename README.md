# Flipper

> Beautiful, performant feature flags for Ruby.

Flipper gives you control over who has access to features in your app.

* Enable or disable features for everyone, specific actors, groups of actors, a percentage of actors, or a percentage of time.
* Configure your feature flags from the console or a web UI.
* Regardless of what data store you are using, Flipper can performantly store your feature flags.
* Use [Flipper Cloud](#flipper-cloud) to cascade features from multiple environments, share settings with your team, control permissions, keep an audit history, and rollback.

Control your software &mdash; don't let it control you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flipper'
```

Optionally, you can pick a [storage adapter](https://flippercloud.io/docs/adapters). This is where the feature flag will be stored. By default, it's stored on memory and the flags you've set will get erased each time your application restarts.

If you choose `active record` as the storage adapter then Flipper will store your feature flag in the database, allowing persistency between restarts. Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flipper-active_record'
```

`flipper-active_record` comes with a generator for creating the database migrations. From your terminal, you can do:

```shell
rails g flipper:active_record
rails db:migrate
```

And then bundle:

```shell
bundle install
```

## Getting Started

To check if a feature flag has been enabled, call `Flipper.enabled?`

```ruby
if Flipper.enabled?(:search)
  # Run search code with Flipper!
else
  # Run alternative code
end
```

Flags are disabled by default. To enable a feature flag, you can do the following:

```ruby
# Enable a feature for everyone
Flipper.enable :search

# Enable a feature for a specific actor
Flipper.enable_actor :search, current_user

# Enable a feature for a group of actors
Flipper.enable_group :search, :admin

# Enable a feature for a percentage of actors
Flipper.enable_percentage_of_actors :search, 2
```

If you choose to enable an actor or group, checking for a feature flag should look something like this:

```ruby
if Flipper.enabled?(:search, current_user)
  # Run search code for the current user
else
  # Run alternative code
end
```

To disable a feature flag, replace enable with disable:

```ruby
# Disable a feature for everyone
Flipper.disable :search

# Disable a feature for a specific actor
Flipper.disable_actor :search, current_user

# Disable a feature for a group of actors
Flipper.disable_group :search, :admin

# Disable a feature for a percentage of actors
Flipper.disable_percentage_of_actors :search, 2
```

## Flipper Cloud

Like Flipper and want more? Check out [Flipper Cloud](https://www.flippercloud.io), which comes with:

* **everything in one place** &mdash; no need to bounce around from different application UIs or IRB consoles.
* **permissions** &mdash; grant access to everyone in your organization or lockdown each project to particular people.
* **multiple environments** &mdash; production, staging, enterprise, by continent, whatever you need.
* **personal environments** &mdash; no more rake scripts or manual enable/disable to get your laptop to look like production. Every developer gets a personal environment that inherits from production that they can override as they please ([read more](https://www.johnnunemaker.com/flipper-cloud-environments/)).
* **no maintenance** &mdash; we'll keep the lights on for you. We also have handy webhooks for keeping your app in sync with Cloud, so **our availability won't affect yours**. All your feature flag reads are local to your app.
* **audit history** &mdash; every feature change and who made it.
* **rollbacks** &mdash; enable or disable a feature accidentally? No problem. You can roll back to any point in the audit history with a single click.

Cloud is super simple to integrate with Rails ([demo app](https://github.com/fewerandfaster/flipper-rails-demo)), Sinatra or any other framework.
